Two calculators, with defensive programming, for my bootcamp.

Simple calculator: The user can enter the sums within the program and it outputs the answer on screen.

Extended calculator: The answers are outputted to results.txt.  The user can type their sum within the program or write their sums on separate lines of sums.txt.
